### Jolt Overview

Jolt is a Java library for transforming JSON data. It allows developers to perform structural transformations on JSON using a series of transformations ("Stock transforms"), which can be **chained together**. The transformation rules are defined in a JSON-based **specification**, making it highly configurable and adaptable to different use cases, such as reshaping data from databases like ElasticSearch, MongoDB, and Cassandra.

### Key Features

1. **Transformations**:
   - **Shift**: Moves data within the JSON structure.
   - **Default**: Adds default values to missing fields.
   - **Remove**: Deletes elements from the JSON structure.
   - **Sort**: Alphabetically sorts map keys for readability.
   - **Cardinality**: Fixes input data structures (e.g., turning single items into lists).

2. **Chaining**:
   - Jolt transforms can be **chained sequentially** to perform complex transformations. Each step processes the JSON and passes the result to the next step.

3. **Shiftr DSL**:
   - **Shiftr** is the most common and powerful transformation, using a **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** to define how data is copied or transformed from input to output JSON.

4. **Declarative Approach**:
   - Jolt uses a declarative configuration approach, with transformations defined in a JSON-based spec. This allows for easy changes and modifications to transformation rules without needing to rewrite Java code.

### Performance Considerations

- **Reuse**: Transforms can be initialized once and reused multiple times.
- **Memory Usage**: Jolt is **memory-based**, so large JSON documents need enough memory to be processed.
- **Garbage Collection**: Transformations may create and discard many objects, leading to garbage collection overhead.

### System Design

Jolt’s system design is based on a **pipeline architecture** using the **Chain of Responsibility** pattern. Here, multiple transformations are applied sequentially, each performing a specific task:

1. **Pipeline/Chain of Transformations**:
   - Transformations are applied in a sequential chain using the `Chainr` class, where JSON flows through each step, transforming it progressively.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Jolt focuses on **structural manipulation**, leaving data-specific transformations (e.g., formatting) to custom code. Each transform has a single responsibility.

3. **Declarative Configuration**:
   - Transformation rules are specified in JSON configuration files, promoting **configurability** and **dynamic adjustments** at runtime without code changes.

4. **Immutable and Stateless Transforms**:
   - Once initialized, transforms are **stateless** and **thread-safe**, allowing reuse across multiple threads without side effects.

5. **Extensibility via Custom Transforms**:
   - Developers can implement custom transformations by extending Jolt’s `Transform` or `ContextualTransform` interfaces.

### Design Patterns

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Each transformation acts as a handler in the chain, processing JSON and passing it to the next.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different transformation types (shift, default, etc.) are strategies for handling JSON.
- **Immutable Pattern**: Once initialized, transformations are immutable, ensuring consistent and thread-safe execution.
- **Composite Pattern**: A collection of transformations (the chain) works together as a composite operation.

---

### Use Cases

- **JSON Restructuring**: Transforming JSON for APIs or other services.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Reshape JSON after extraction from databases or REST APIs.
- **API Gateways**: Transform input/output JSON to fit various API formats.
- **Data Enrichment**: Add metadata or default values before sending JSON downstream.

---

### Example Usage

A typical workflow involves loading a JSON spec and input, applying transformations using `Chainr`, and producing the final transformed output:

```java
Chainr chainr = JsonUtils.classpathToList("/path/to/spec.json");
Object input = elasticSearchHit.getSource();
Object output = chainr.transform(input);
return output;
```

---

### Summary

Jolt provides a powerful, declarative, and extensible system for transforming JSON data, focusing on structure rather than specific data manipulation. By using a **chain of transformations** and supporting custom extensions, it enables complex JSON reshaping with flexibility and efficiency, especially useful in ETL pipelines, API gateways, and data enrichment processes.
